In a time where it seems like you can't find good polite customer service Sirius restored my faith in humanity and kindness.. My husband's is a truck driver and Sirius provides a lot of companionship for him while he's gone, he is the sole provider for our family and we can't afford for him to take time off, recently I had surgery and he had to take time off for it, well his radio got shut off during this time. When I called them I was hoping to get a cheaper subscription so I could turn his radio back on as soon as possible. I told the gentleman the circumstances and he seemed to genuinely care, we ended up getting 6 mo of service for less than 40 bucks and he turned it back on without payment and gave me two weeks to pay. Thank you so much. It really meant a lot to me...

Always perfect representatives, one of my favorite companies I subscribe to. Polite, helpful, and everything is clear and straightforward. The service itself is fantastic, amazing selection of channels. My only complaint would be the streaming website can sometimes be a little buggy but usually is fine.

It took me some time to get through to the right channels. Once I did, the agent worked patiently with me and responded appropriately to all my needs and requests. If I should ever need further assistance, I will again contact the same manager.

I bought a brand new car in 2013 and was given a free trial. I enjoyed it very much. I have renewed my subscription ever since. I love it. When I renew, I have always been treated with great respect and courtesy. The customer service agents are very easy to understand and are real nice. I have had no problems with giving them my credit card information. They told me they don't keep the number on file and I have not had any unauthorized charges. If you don't feel comfortable giving out your number, you may pay with a check, but I think there is a small $2.00 service charge for that.

I’ve been a subscriber for 15 years and have never, even once, had a problem. And, yes, I’ve contacted their customer support people to add/delete vehicles, services, etc. They’ve always been cooperative and done my bidding.

Bought a car and had 3 months free. I was enjoying the Sirius so decided to call and get a renewal. Called Feb 24, gave me a deal $79.95 all in for the year. So I chose to renew. Gave a prepaid credit card over the phone on Feb 24, recieved a call March 2 stating I have an outstanding balance. I called back and they claim there is no record. So needless to say the prepaid Visa has done an investigation and lo and behold one of Sirius's employees took the prepaid card number and decided to buy his own stuff.

I have had SiriusXM radio for nine years or so and it seems every year if I don’t check my automatic subscription renewal kicks in and I continually get overcharged. And I finally cancel my subscription before deployment last July but continue to get charge for five additional months until finally I had to put a stop payment on my credit card.

I bought a new car. Needed to change my subscription to my new vehicle. I got an email that I could switch it online but when I tried the link froze, so now I have to call. I call, hold for not even one minute and am connected to a gentleman named John ** (or something very similar). I explain to him what I'm trying to do and he's I believe explaining to me how it's going to work with my current subscription and my free 6 month subscription but not very well. After several minutes of him repeating the same thing I asked to talk to someone else telling him I don't think he understands my question. He then tells me, "** you" and does not transfer me.

After charging our debit card $363 for a one year subscription for one vehicle without any notice, we called to negotiate a better deal.... We were told if we signed up both vehicles, it would be $120 for the year. When we went to complete the transaction, they changed it to $120 for each vehicle for a total of $240 plus taxes and fees! BUYER BEWARE OF THEIR DECEPTIVE TACTICS!

My wife's Hyundai came equipped with a Radio that could receive XM radio. As a promotion for buying the car, we received a six month "FREE" subscription. We enjoyed listening to our favorite channels that were relatively free of commercial interruptions. When the free promotional period expired, we signed up for another 6 months of the service. Now, we have made our decision to sell the car, we will no longer require the service. I attempted to go online and cancel in the same fashion I had used to activate my subscription. Nowhere on the site was a method of cancellation that did NOT require a phone call.

In these times when we can easily connect our phones to our cars and listen to an assortment of music and other choices it is beyond me why Sirius XM still charges these outrageous rates. I had a subscription which I canceled today after 5 years because I am sick of having to call them every 5 months to renegotiate my rate and it is only when I threaten to cancel that they offer to do better. Today I asked them to not automatically renew my subscription but to email me when it was about to expire and let me decide if I want to renew or not. Their response was they would have to cancel me unless I agreed to be automatically renewed. In my humble opinion what they offer in comparison to what I can get by simply connecting to my phone is not worth it.

If one can opt for automatic renewal online, you should be able to cancel that same feature online. I subscribe to many services through online registrations, this is the only company in which you can only cancel your online automatic payment feature by making a phone. Very questionable practice!

Twelve months ago my car was new, I am a first time member of Sirius. I've used it in friends and rental cars and always thought it was great. I still do. Finances are not what they once were and when my 12 month promo plan ended I was going to change my service plan. I was concerned because I was pretty sure they had an auto-renew on my credit card; THAT was my mistake, I try and avoid those things. I'm a pretty busy guy and didn't really want to deal with this on the phone. Although this will far from break me, while considering free vs $100.00+ a year I wanted to cancel for a few weeks to see if I really missed it. On their website it was not easy finding cancel my service. Not surprised at that.

My yearly cost went from about $135 per year for the last two years to $301 this year. I can understand a slight increase as every company has increasing costs but this is incredibly excessive. The excuse they give is that I was given special promotional rates over the past two years and now those are over and I'm back to my regular price. I have never paid $300/year for this service and the $135 from the last two years was an increase over the previous 8-10 years I have been a customer. Thankfully, I did not commit to automatic renewal in the past because I was concerned something like this may happen. This is an outright attempt to dishonestly take advantage of their customers. The management at SiriusXM should be ashamed of themselves.

I used to enjoy XM radio and had subscriptions in 3 cars. They raised the rates so I cut down to 2 cars (and had to call several times because they kept fraudulently adding the 3rd radio back on). Now they stabbed me in the back by doubling my rate without any notice whatsoever. I have recently found Echo Auto with which you can listen to thousands of stations for free, so why would I pay $58/month for something vastly inferior. Took an hour to cancel the service and and will not ever be back to this rip off. They even have the gall to have commercials while charging you for the service. Goodbye SiriusXM and Good Riddance.

Beware of Sirius XM billing scam! My husband was a customer for 14 years and paid them over $4000. We haven't listened to this radio for months and I saw two separate charges on our two separate credit cards. One of them didn't show up on billing statement. When I called to cancel the service, I was told the charge was a MONTHLY membership fee in the amount of $22, that's besides his $28 monthly service charge. HORRIBLE! Absolutely disgusting scam. I hope we're done with them for good!

I received a threatening phone call from a collection agency saying I owed $52.12 for a previous subscription in the year 2018/2019 in January 2020. I did not give them updated credit card info after paying in full for the prior 2018/2019 year 2 car account for May 2018 thru May 2019. I tried during that subscription year to add a 3rd car, after having a new radio with XM capable feature installed. The radio would play the xm channel #1 and the music and words could be heard. After 3 or 4 calls to support to get this radio activated without success, I gave up. Money spent on new radio was wasted. It turns out Sirius placed a charge on my account for the 3rd radio without ever being able to activate it. They sent that charge to collections in July 2019 without an invoice, statement, or call about the charge.

The ONLY reason I am giving them one star is because I have to give them a rating. I would really like to rate them ZERO STARS!!!! I tried cancelling my account this morning. I have the basic package, $15 a month. When I called, it took almost 20 minutes to get through to a real human. Once I got through, I asked to cancel my service and they told me that because there was a balance on my account, they could not cancel it. I told them there was no balance on my account because I was looking at my bank statement showing that this month's payment had been deducted. Once I told him this, he accused me of LYING about paying my bill!! When I asked to speak to a manager I was told that managers only speak to those who have a valid reason.

Because of a problem having my credit card marked as lost or stolen, because the new one sent did not show up. that is registered to my account is null and void to anyone trying to use it. So used a $75 gift card to pay a $55 renewal for 6 months. So guess what?? They have the $75 showing as deposited into my account but refuse to pay the owed amount because there is no usable credit card information that they can charge anything to, which they should not have to do. All service was supposed to be cancelled yesterday. Will have to wait and see if that has happened the next time in my car. Have started onto them on their Facebook page and boy they sure do not like any of this information going out on social media, which is exactly what it does. THE BATTLE CONTINUES.

My experience is like many other reviewers on here. It's almost impossible, and frustrating as hell. And ensures that I won't be going back (READ THAT CEO and Customer Service). I have been a customer with an account that had multiple radios (3 at one time) for 14+ years. Since I travel 100%, and pay almost $500/year, I decided to cancel. The price has continued to go up every year, the service options has decreased in recent years and my use has declined significantly. All reasonable reasons.... And oh yeah, MY DECISION. So when I called in because you can do EVERYTHING online BUT CANCEL, I expected to have to decline counter offers... So I settled in.

I received an email that my subscription was going to run out, and it would be automatically renewed for a whopping $297. First off, there's no way to cancel online... They make it impossible to do that - and it's for a reason. They want to get you on the phone to 'talk you out' of canceling. The guy I spoke with kept offering lower prices... OK, then why not offer low prices ALL ALONG? That in and of itself is manipulative. He kept insisting I listen to his promotions. I finally snapped at the guy (which I don't like to do) and he said he would go ahead and cancel it.

I have been a customer of Sirius for 15 years. I have a lifetime subscription and have 5 separate radios that have regular monthly service. I got a new car and I am told that to get the same service I have had for 15 years I now have to UPGRADE my service and that it will only be good for 42 months. Then I would have to UPGRADE AGAIN. They never should have let the merger go through. Now they have the corner of the satellite radio market and are screwing people every chance they get. I am being told that because my car has an XM radio and not a Sirius radio that I can no longer get the same services I have had for 15 years without paying $204.44. SHAME on you Sirius XM. It should be irrelevant to what kind of car I buy and the best part is I was told to go to the junk yard and find a car like mine that has a Sirius radio in it and put it in my new car..

I get an email saying my credit card is being charged $18.63 in 9 days. I called to ask why. They say that my subscription is expiring and offer me a new price starting today. I say why not just start it after the 9 days. They say that I just cancelled it! I said that I was cancelling the “renewal” in 9 days. The girl did not understand English and that I have to accept their offer basically. Since I wasn’t going to accept it at that exact moment, they will refund my credit card the amount of $1.77 for the next 9 days! What kind of sales tactic is this? She offered me a “layaway” plan. I asked her what this was exactly. (Now I bought clothes on “layaway” when I was in college and the store would hold them until I could pay them off, but this was confusing to me because this is a subscription to a radio service.) She had a very thick foreign accent with broken English and I asked her to explain her version of “layaway”. She had no clue!

She has a serous codependent denial who problem and refuses to face the matter or look into it. This has caused me extreme stress. I've had to turn my phone off so many times I can't count.

Cancellation is a nightmare. Doesn't matter what 800/888 number you call you will be referred to a different Telephone or transferred to the cancellation dept where you'll be on hold forever. I called one of the 800 numbers and had my personal information verified and then transferred to cancellation. I spent over 60 minutes waiting for someone to answer which no ever did answer. I tried using the chat program but was told I wasn't in the system and the person I'm chatting with couldn't cancel my subscription.

I swapped out the head unit in my car with a new one, and that requires me to call Sirius/XM to swap the radio ID on my account. I called the number that popped up on the radio itself, and spent about 5 minutes talking to an agent who then told me that he couldn't help me because my new radio comes with 3 free months of service, so I had to call another number, which - bonus - was closed right now. What? So because I get 3 free months of service, I have to...go without service until a different department that isn't open right now can talk to me? So I call that number the next day and hey, guess what, 22 minute hold time. Fun. Yo, Sirius, why not have the number that's set up for setting up new radios be able to...set up new radios?
